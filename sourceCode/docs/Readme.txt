Thank you for downloading Deep Space Pirates!

The development is still at the beginning: this version won't likely work on your machine, is just intended for our internal testing.
You can report any problem on the sourceforge tracker: https://sourceforge.net/p/dspirates/tickets/

To launch the game double click on ...dsp\dsPirates\game\dsPirates.exe
Keys:
Q to quit
move the mouse to steer - center the mouse to stop rotating
use the mouse weel to set the forward/backward speed
the spacebar or the left mouse button to shoot
T to change the information in the cockpit computer
F1, F2, F3, F10, F11, F12 to change view
enter in the numeric keypad for the credits

Commands that won't work as expected:
W A S D X C to move
U J I O K L to rotate
this have no effect, as the mouse controlled guidance computer will correct the movement they cause almost immediately.
